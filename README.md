Welcome to Getsy, a clone of Etsy where users can browse through various
shops and items that are for sale from other users.

Navigate through the site with or without signing in.  In order to
access adding a shop or items, however, you will need to be logged in.  
If you are just checking things out, I have provided a guest login.  
You will have access to the Guest Shop's edit and create forms.  You
may also create a brand new shop and list items for sale.  

This is a work in progress. Moving forward I would like to incorporate
the following:
- [ ] Add quantity control to cart and items
- [ ] Follow shops
- [ ] Mailer for sign up/ password resets/ purchase confirmations
- [ ] Custom shop urls
- [ ] Categorized items with tags
- [ ] Pagination/infinite scroll
- [ ] Activity history (e.g. likes, recent searches)
- [ ] Comments/Likes on reviews
- [ ] User avatars
- [ ] More robust searches
